    "<h2>Basic ODE interface.</h2>\n",
    "The way you interact with DifferentialEquations package to solve ODEs is as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "* First you must write your ODE as a system of first order equations of the form $\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec x = f(\\vec x)$.\n",
    "* Then you define a Julia function to evaluate $f$.  The function must take three arguments.  The first is the current state of the differential equation solution $\\vec x$.  The second argument is a vector of parameters.  The third argument is the current time.  The function does not need to actually depend on all these arguments, but they have to be there.  E.g. to solve the ODE $u' = - u$, you could define the function \n",

    "function f(x::Vector{Float64},p,t)\n",
    "    return -x\n",
    "end\n",

    "* Define an initial condition vector, e.g. `x_init = [1.0, 0.5]`, and a time range, e.g. `tspan = (0.0, 1.0)`.\n",

    "```julia\n",
    "prob = ODEProblem(f,x_init,tspan)\n",

    "* Solve the problem with the function `solve`, e.g.\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "sol = solve(prob; save_everystep = true )\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The object `sol` contains all the information you are likely to want.  There are different ways to extract that info.  E.g. if you want a plot of the solution, you can usually just call `plot(sol)`.  If you want the raw data, you can get it via `sol.u[j]` for the solution values at time step $j$ and `sol.t[j]` for the time value at time step $j$.  You can also call the solution as a function to get the solution value at any interpolated time, e.g. `sol(1.5)`. "
