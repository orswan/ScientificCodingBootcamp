    "We now come to linear algebra.  The power of linear algebra is that it lets you reason geometrically about algebra, and it lets you reason algebraically about geometry.  We begin with the very useful singular value decomposition (SVD) and the related pseudo-inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD breaks an arbitrary matrix into a composition of a rotation, a stretching (diagonal matrix), and another rotation.  More explicitly, SVD of an arbitrary matrix M is given by U*S*V', where U and V are rotation matrices, S is diagonal, and ' denotes the conjugate-transpose.  The singular values tell you a lot about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible, and they are usually sorted from largest to smallest.  (Remarkably, this works even if M is not a square matrix.  Question: What do you think it means for a non-square matrix to be \"diagonal\"?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudoinverse is the \"closest to an inverse you can get\".  If a matrix M is invertable, the pseudoinverse pinv(M) is just the regular inverse M^{-1}.  If M is not invertable but it is diagonal, then the pinv(M) is computed by inverting each non-zero diagonal element and leaving every other element zero.  In the general case, if the SVD of M is U*S*V', the pseudoinverse of M is V*pinv(S)*transpose(U). "
